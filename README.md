## Usage

The `randomWord` function returns a promise that contains a random PT-BR word:

The `fetchWords` function returns a promise that contains an array of all PT-BR words available [here](https://github.com/pythonprobr/palavras):

import { fetchWords } from 'palavra-aleatoria";

const words = await fetchWords();
// [...]
```
